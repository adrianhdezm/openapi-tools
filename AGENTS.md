# AGENTS.md

For every commit made by an automated agent, follow the guidelines defined in `.github/commit-instructions.md`【F:.github/commit-instructions.md】.

1. **Commit‐Message Template**
   - All commit messages must adhere exactly to the structure and rules in `.github/commit-instructions.md` (types, scopes, header/body/footer, line lengths, issue references, etc.)【F:.github/commit-instructions.md】.
   - Do not amend or rebase existing commits; create new commits only.
